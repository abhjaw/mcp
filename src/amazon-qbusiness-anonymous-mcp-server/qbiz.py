Amazon Q Business anonymous mode MCP Server

This module provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Amazon Q Business created using anonymous mode.
It allows users to query Amazon Q Business through an MCP tool interface, handling authentication,
error management, and response formatting automatically.

Features:
- Synchronous chat queries to Amazon Q Business
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Environment-based configuration

Required Environment Variables:
    AWS_REGION: The AWS region where your Q Business application is deployed
    QBUSINESS_APPLICATION_ID: The unique identifier for your Q Business application
    
AWS Credentials:
    This module requires valid AWS credentials to be configured. Credentials can be provided via:
    - AWS CLI configuration (~/.aws/credentials)
    - Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN)
    - IAM roles (when running on EC2 or other AWS services)
    - AWS SSO profiles

Usage:
    Run as an MCP server:
        uv run qbiz.py
    
    Or import and use the functions directly:
        from qbiz import qbiz_local_query
        response = qbiz_local_query("What is our company policy?")
    
    Or configure in mcp.json as below
    "qbiz": {
        "command": "uv",
        "args": [
            "--directory",
            "<REPLACE-WITH-FULL-PATH-FOR-qbiz-mcp-server-DIRECTORY>",
            "run",
            "qbiz.py"
        ],
        "env": {
            "QBUSINESS_APPLICATION_ID":"<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AMAZON-Q-BUSINESS-APPLICATION-ID>",
            "AWS_REGION":"<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-REGION>",
            "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID":"<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-ACCESS-KEY>",
            "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY":"<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY>",
            "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN":"<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-SESSION-TOKEN>"
        }
    }

Dependencies:
    - boto3: AWS SDK for Python
    - mcp: Model Context Protocol library
    - Standard library modules: os, secrets, json
